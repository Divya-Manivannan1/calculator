Hi! This is a calculator app, that I created as a part of the _nology coursework.
This calculator works with the BIDMAS order of precedence, wherein addition and subtraction have the same precedence.

<b>Special features of my calculator:</b>
<ul>
  <li>In special buttons:
    <ul>
  <li>By clicking the CE button, the entire expression can be deleted.</li>
  <li>By clicking the DEL button, the last entered value can be deleted while ensiring that all the checks remain valid.</li>
  <li>When the equal button is pressed, the result is now available as the working expression.</li>
  <li>When the equal button is pressed, the expression is stored in the memory.</li>
  <li>Memory can be viewed in the mobile version by clicking on the M button</li>
  <li>Memory can be cleared by using the CM button.</li>
    </ul></li>
  
  <li>In bracket buttons:<ul>
  <li>Whenever "(" is pressed after a number, it becomes "*("</li>
  <li>Whenever a number is pressed after ")", it becomes ")*"</li>
  <li>The number of ")" cannot exceed that of "(".</li>
    <li>A symbol cannot be pressed immediately after "("</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li>In "." button:
    <ul><li>Checks in place prevent numbers from having 2 decimal points</li>
    <li>If "." is the first button clicked, it becomes "0."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>In symbol buttons:
  <ul>
    <li>A symbol cannot be the first value entered.</li>
    <li>A symbol cant be entered right after another symbol.</li>
    <li>If a symbol is pressed after a decimal point: ".*" it becomes ".0*"</li>
  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
